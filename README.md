JS-Paper.io2 is a clone of the popular paper.io2 game in vanilla javascript. This script can be ran locally or on a webserver. I plan to add a we socket server to this eventually for PvP and PvBot team playing. It has a union bug I can't seem to remove but I am optimistic that I will fix it along the way. If anyone has a fix for this I would be happy to accept commits.
